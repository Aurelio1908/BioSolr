# BioSolr - Ontologies

This area contains projects related to ontologies, including search
engine plugins for enriching documents with ontology data.

The solr/solr-facet-tree directory contains a plugin for generating
a tree of facets from a set of results. This can be used to present
facets built from ontology data in a tree structure. There are several
presentation options available for modifying the tree format.
