# BioSolr Ontologies - Solr plugins

This directory contains the Solr plugins that have been developed as
part of the BioSolr project.

The following plugins are available:

* **solr-facet-tree** - a plugin for generating a tree of facets from a set
of results. These can be used to present facets built from ontology data in
a tree structure. There are several presentation options available for
modifying the tree format.

* **solr-ontology-updateprocessor** - a Solr update processor for enriching
documents with ontology data at index time. Similar to the ElasticSearch
Ontology Annotator, but requires more configuration.
