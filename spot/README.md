# BioSolr - SPOT team

This is the SPOT team area of the BioSolr github repository.

The spot-ontology directory contains a project hierarchy for both indexing and
searching across an ontology index linked to an annotated document index.

The solr-hierarchical-facet directory contains a Solr plugin for generating hierarchical
facets from a set of results. This can be used to present ontology facets, for example,
in a tree structure.
