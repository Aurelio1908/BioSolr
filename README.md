BioSolr
=======

Funded by the BBSRC http://www.bbsrc.ac.uk/ this collaboration between Flax and the European Bioinformatics Institute (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/) aims “to significantly advance the state of the art with regard to indexing and querying biomedical data with freely available open source software”. Here's some background:
http://www.flax.co.uk/blog/2014/06/11/biosolr-building-better-search-for-bioinformatics/

Here's a poster about the project http://f1000research.com/posters/4-491 and presentation http://f1000research.com/slides/4-492

We'll be using this repository to publish the open source software we develop to enhance and improve the use of the Apache Lucene/Solr search engine for this important sector.

To round off this phase of the BioSolr project there is an open workshop on 3rd/4th February 2016 at EMBL-EBI http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/about/events/open-source-search-bioinformatics - a great chance to hear more about open source search for bioinformatics with Apache Lucene/Solr and Elasticsearch
