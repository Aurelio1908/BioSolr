BioSolr
=======

Funded by the BBSRC http://www.bbsrc.ac.uk/ this collaboration between Flax and the European Bioinformatics Institute (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/) aims “to significantly advance the state of the art with regard to indexing and querying biomedical data with freely available open source software”. Here's some background:

Here's a poster about the project http://f1000research.com/posters/4-491 and presentation http://f1000research.com/slides/4-492

We'll be using this repository to publish the open source software we develop to enhance and improve the use of the Apache Lucene/Solr search engine for this important sector.
